                <li>245 grams (1 cup) whole milk</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>118.5 grams (1/2 cup) warm water</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>1 package (7 gr) instant yeast (can use active dry but you will have to bloom it first)
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>2 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>

                <li>1 tablespoon vanilla bean paste (can use extract)</li>

                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, very soft but not melted

                <p></p>
                <li>741-800 grams (~5 3/4 - 6 1/4 cups) AP flour
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>6 grams (1 teaspoon) kosher salt
                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li>2 cups pearl sugar

            <p>Instructions:</p>
            <ol class="aside">
                <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the milk, water, and yeast</li>
                <li>Stop the mixer and add in the eggs, honey, and vanilla. Mix until combined. Add in 2 cups of flour
                    and mix until the flour is hydrated and mostly mixed in. Stop the mixer, scrape down the paddle
                    attachment, and switch to the dough hook.</li>
                <li>Add in the salt and 1/2 cup of flour at a time with the mixer on low until all of the flour is
                    combined. You may not need all of the flour depending on how humid your space is. The flour dough
                    should start to pull away slightly. Next, add in the butter one tablespoon at a time. Be patient
                    here as the butter will take a few minutes to incorporate itself into the dough. The dough will come
                    back together. Remove the dough ball from the bowl and transfer it to a larger clean bowl lightly
                    greased. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit on the counter in a warm, dry place until doubled in
                    size (1-3 hours).
                </li>
                <li>When doubled, deflate the dough by punching it down in the center and bringing the edges of the
                    dough over the top (like you’re folding it into itself). Replace the cover and put the bowl of dough
                    in the fridge to allow it to ferment overnight.*Note you can skip the overnight fridge resting if
                    you are short on time. Move to step 6 to continue. The cold ferment just helps develop more flavors
                    in the waffle.</li>
                <li>If you cold fermented the dough, the next day, remove the dough from the fridge and allow the dough
                    to come to room temp (about 2 hours).</li>
                <li>Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a lightly floured board. Flatten the dough out into a
                    rectangle and spread out 1 1/2 cups of pearl sugar. Fold the bottom third up and then the top third
                    on top of that. Press down and add the rest of the pearl sugar. Fold the sides up to form a
                    rectangle. Slowly cup the dough and roll it out into a log about 12-14” long Divide the dough into
                    12 pieces, shape into balls, flatten slightly into round discs, and place on a parchment-lined pan.
                    Cover with lightly sprayed plastic wrap.</li>
                <li>Heat up your Belgian waffle maker. Since all makers are different, you’ll have to fiddle around with
                    yours. I would advise starting off on low and increase the temperature a little at a time until you
                    find the correct setting that will caramelize your sugars and cook your waffles to the perfect
                    golden caramel brown. Spray the iron with non-stick spray and place a round of dough in the center
                    of your waffle maker. Close and cook until the waffle puffs up, cooked through and the sugar pearls
                    are caramelized. Carefully remove from the maker, and serve immediately or place it on a cooling
                    rack.</li>
